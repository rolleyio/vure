# Vure

This is a proof of concept to see if Vue and Firebase (Vure) can create a firestore powered ssg app (built on top of typesaurus and firebase v9), powered by Vite

## TODO
- Get login / firestore models working with zod validation
- Re-add testing for typesaurus
- Allow firebase emulator port override in config
- Add firebase rules tests
- Allow zod to check schemas
- Cleanup onEvents in onBeforeUnmount
