# Vure

This is a proof of concept to see if Vue and Firebase (Vure) can create a firestore powered ssg app (built on top of typesaurus and firebase v9), powered by Vite

## TODO
- Change all initialise functions to actually initialise rather than get
- Change typesaurus to jest (Wonder if we can merge typesaurus/firebase v9 back if they're interested)
- Have zod schema parse data if a schema is provided
